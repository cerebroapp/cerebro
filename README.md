## Build executable from source

If you would like to install one version of Cerebro but the executable has not been released you can follow this isntruction to build it from source:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`

3. ```bash
    yarn package
   ```

> Note: in CI we use `yarn build` as there is an action to package and publish the executables

## Install executable on Linux

If you are a linux user you might need to grant execution permissions to the executable. To do so, open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod +x <path to the executable>
```

Then you can install the executable by running the following command:

- If you are using the AppImage executable:

  ```bash
  ./<path to the executable>
  ```

- If you are using the deb executable:

  ```bash
  dpkg -i <path to the executable>
  ```
