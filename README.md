## Create plugin

Check out [plugins documentation](./docs/plugins.md).

### Build executable from source

If you would like to install one version but the package is not published you can use this command to build executable file from source:

```bash
yarn package
```

> Note: in CI we use `yarn build` as there is an action to package and publish the executables

#### Config file path

*Windows*: `%APPDATA%/Cerebro/config.json`

*Linux*: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Cerebro/config.json`  or `~/.config/Cerebro/config.json`

*macOS*: `~/Library/Application Support/Cerebro/config.json`

### Resolve common issues

1. `AssertionError: Current node version is not supported for development` on npm postinstall.
After `yarn` postinstall script checks node version. If you see this error you have to check node and npm version in `package.json` `devEngines` section and install proper ones.

2. `Uncaught Error: Module version mismatch. Exepcted 50, got ...`
This error means that node modules with native extensions build with wrong node version (your local node version != node version, included to electron). To fix this issue run `cd ./app && yarn run rebuild`

### Conventional Commit Format

The project is using conventional commit specification to keep track of changes. This helps us with the realeases and enforces a consistent style.
You can commit as usually or use the following commands that will help you to commit with the right style:

* `yarn cz`
* `yarn commit`

### Publish a release

CerebroApp is using GH actions to build the app and publish it to a release. To publish a new release follow the steps below:

1. Update the version on both `package.json` and `app/package.json` files.
2. Create a release with from GH and publish it. üöß The release **tag** MUST contain the `v` prefix (‚ùå `0.1.2` ‚Üí ‚úÖ`v0.1.2`).
3. Complete the name with a name and a description of the release.
4. The GH action is triggered and the release is updated when executables are built.

### Add dependencies

CerebroApp was created from an [old version of electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/cerebroapp/cerebro/commit/57b6e28c0f64beae8948cf17f099fa5d6236ae3c) and uses a two package.json file structure. If you are interested in developing a new feature, you should read about this structure in the [electron-react-boilerplate documentation](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure.html).
